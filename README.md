# Deep-Learning-Basics
# Practical 1
1: Implement a single-layer perceptron model in Python to classify binary inputs using a step activation function. Test its performance on a simple binary classification problem.
2: Utilize the single perceptron to simulate basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT). Design the perceptron architecture to classify inputs based on predefined threshold values.
3: Extend the perceptron implementation to simulate complex logic gates (NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR). Validate the outputs using different combinations of binary inputs.

# Practical 2
1: Implement the perceptron learning algorithm to classify 3-dimensional points into two classes based on a given dataset. Update weights iteratively until convergence.
2: Develop a Python program to determine the number of linearly separable binary classification problems from a given dataset of 3-dimensional points. Validate using multiple class combinations.
3: Analyze the convergence of the perceptron learning algorithm by varying the learning rate and epochs. Evaluate its impact on classification accuracy.
